  <h2>Sequence Alignment Algorithms</h2>

  <p>There are a couple purposes that I have for writing this code.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>To create sequence alignment algorithms that give full control of all types of gap penalties. This code implements:</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Pre-sequence penalties</li>
      <li>In-sequence penalties</li>
      <li>Post-sequence penalties</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Each penalty type contains a start and continue penalty for each sequence individually.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>To write the full versions of the alignment algorithms I use.</li>
    <li>To write it in such a way that someone else could (hopefully) easily read it.</li>
  </ol>
